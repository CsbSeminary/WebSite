<h3>Evangelism &amp; Church Planting with a European Worldview</h3>
</em></em></h3>
</em></h3>
<p>
2 Credit Hours (on campus) <img alt="" src="/Media/Images/school_icon.jpg" /><br />
<strong><br />
Instructor:</strong> <strong>Dr. Mark Edworthy (IMB)<br />
</strong><em>Dr. Mark Edworthy is a top leader at the International Mission Board of the SBC giving strategic direction to the work among the European people groups. He was appointed as a church planter to Poland in 1991 and planted the first IMB-initiated church in the former Soviet Union. It was in those early days that he and his wife Suzie became good friends to&nbsp; the Booths when they were serving in Hungary. Mark comes with a broad range of practical ministry experience (at one time he even coached an American football team in Poland as an outreach strategy); and he is a great teacher and public speaker. He has written one of the books that will be used in the class entitled, &ldquo;The Wall that Remains,&rdquo; which chronicles some of the stories in Europe in those pivotal years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<strong>Course Description: </strong>Europe is not as monolithic in its worldview as it is may have been in the past. The current context includes Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Muslims, as well as post-modern atheists, not unlike the pluralistic setting of Canada in the 21st century. This course will address the challenges of sharing Christ in this context and will include Skyping with some who are currently doing just that. Students will learn principles of evangelism in cross-cultural settings as well as strategies for church planting. The instructor will also share about the history of Southern Baptist work in Europe among these peoples and discuss lessons learned.<br />
