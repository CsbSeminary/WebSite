<h4>Test of English as a Foreign Language</h4>
<p>Since the language of instruction is English, applicants must be proficient in both verbal and written English.&nbsp; All applicants (regardless of citizenship) whose first language is not English must submit the result of the TOEFL test.&nbsp; Test scores must be no more than 2 years old.&nbsp; CSBS&amp;C reserves the right to require any student to submit proof of adequate English skills before admission regardless of educational background, citizenship status, country of origin, or stated primary language.&nbsp; (The TOEFL English language proficiency test measures the ability of non-native speakers of English to use and understand North American English as it is used in higher education.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Applicants must submit an IBT (internet based) TOEFL score of no less than 83 with a minimum score of 20 in speaking, listening, reading and a minimum score of 22 in writing.&nbsp; The institutional code is 3209.&nbsp; An IELTS score of 6.5 with no band less than 5.0 or other approved language assessment tests may be considered.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Proof of English proficiency may not be required for applicants who have attended secondary or post-secondary institutions where the language of instruction and examination is English. Please contact our Admissions office for further information. Please note that CSBS&amp;C does not currently have a centre for English language instruction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Students who, in the judgment of the faculty, are found to be inadequately prepared in the English language regardless of TOEFL score, may be placed on academic probation or suspension due to language deficiencies. The TOEFL test score must be no more than 2 years old. Additional evidence of writing skills might also be requested. Information for this test may be found online at:</p>
