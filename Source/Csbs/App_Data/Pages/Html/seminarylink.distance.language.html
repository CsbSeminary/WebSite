            Daily Grammar is the brainchild of Pete Peterson, former Executive Vice President of Word Perfect. Pete wanted to find a way to easily teach grammar to those in need of lessons. In order to fulfill his wish, Pete sought out the help of Mr. Bill Johansen. Mr. Johansen wrote all of the Daily Grammar lessons and quizzes. Mr. Johanson has dedicated over thirty years of his life preparing children for college and professional settings by teaching English classes in both high school and junior high schools.
