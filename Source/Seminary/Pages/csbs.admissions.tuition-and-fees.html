<br />
Online or occasional students as well as first semester on campus students are not eligible to apply for deferred payment.<br />
<br />
Students will not be allowed to attend class if the above requirements are not satisfied. <br />
<br />
Students with unpaid balances at the end of a semester will not be permitted to write their final exams and grades will not be issued. In addition, students with outstanding student account balances will not be able to register for classes in the following semester. <br />
