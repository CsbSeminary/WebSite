<p>
2 Credit Hours (on campus) <img alt="" src="/Media/Images/school_icon.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <strong>Dr. Jimmy Cobb</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course Description: </strong>Just a few clarifications about the Bonhoeffer course: (1) We will deal with Bonhoeffer's theology, listen to his own words with minimum input from his various interpreters. (2) Pre-work reading assignment for the first day of class in order to cover his main material. The textbook, <em>The Bonhoeffer Reader </em>offers students a chance to read his own words from different phases of his life. We will certainly review his better known writings (<em>Cost of Discipleship </em>and <em>Life Together</em>) but also consider his lesser known writings. We will concentrate on his writings in the mornings. (3) In the afternoons, we'll lighten up a bit with video material mainly about his life and times which hopefully will help students understand his theology in his life context.<br />
