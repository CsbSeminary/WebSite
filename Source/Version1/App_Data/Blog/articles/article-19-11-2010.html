<h1 style="color: #d81e00;">A fond farewell and a warm welcome</h1>
<p>When a president and dean receive news that a faculty member is leaving, there can always be cause for concern, especially when that person is as well-loved and respected as Tim Williams. Joining the faculty 3 years ago as the Nehemiah Professor of Church Planting, Tim quickly integrated into the Seminary family and immediately began to make an impact. He contributed to the strength of the school across those 3 years in ways both seen and unseen. And his contribution to the ministry was not limited to the campus but was distributed across the Convention as he encouraged and mentored church planters in multiple locations.</p>
<p>With students it is sometimes hard to send off those we have come to know and love, but that is what God has called us to do. Occasionally we have to release beloved staff and faculty as well to pursue God&rsquo;s call upon their lives. And so with mixed emotions we bless Tim and Amy as they have relocated to New Orleans to serve the Lord there. And of course, since the Lord is the One who is at work here, He was also faithful once more to raise up another choice servant to step in and take up where Tim left off.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, Dan Morgan went to Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary to study and there caught a passion for church planting. He took part in planting a church as an M.Div. student and later returned to Southwestern to earn his doctorate in church planting. Dan has served as a Church Planter Strategist for the North American Mission Board (NAMB) in Portland, Oregon (1993-1998) and on staff at Saddleback Church in California (1998 to 2001) as a church planter trainer and coach. From 2001 to 2009, Dan was the Director of the Nehemiah Project for Church Planting at SWBTS, and most recently has served with NAMB on the Missional Network Team.</p>
<p>Dan and Melanie have 4 grown children who live in the Ft. Worth, TX area. They arrived in Cochrane this summer just in time for the beginning of the fall semester. As someone who has known them previously, Dwight Huffman, Pastor at Bow Valley Baptist Church, writes, &ldquo;The Father has again been very gracious with the CNBC and the CSBS to send to us another godly couple to partner with us in Canada. Dan and Melanie bring many years of experience in the area of church planting and leadership development and truly have a deep love and commitment to Christ. It will be an honor to serve alongside them here in Alberta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having a church planting professor at our school is a non-negotiable. It is part of the DNA of the seminary and college. We are grateful to God once more for His timely and gracious provision for our faculty needs. We welcome Dan and Melanie to our team, and we are excited about what God has in store through our ministry together.</p>
