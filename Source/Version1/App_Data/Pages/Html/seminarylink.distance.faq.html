    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Courses"></a>How do online studies work?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Overview.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Online Studies follow the semester format. You may choose to enroll in a single course or participate in several courses at one time. Students in each course progress through a structured series of course material and learning experiences, guided by the faculty and instructors. Assignments require students to engage in activities that are both academic and practical.</li>
        <li>The courses are designed to help you benefit from the learning community that surrounds you. Your commitments to family, church, ministry, and community become key components in your personal development in the courses. Substantive online interaction with faculty and students of other backgrounds further enriches the experience.</li>
        <li>Course requirements that include online postings follow a schedule so that you may complete the assignments at your convenience prior to the due date/time.</li>
        <li>The online connection will be made through your Internet Service Provider (ISP), but the electronic classrooms will be managed through the Distance Learning Center web page. Students will be issued user names and passwords in order to have access to the courses and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. What should I know?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A basic level of computer proficiency is required for successful completion of an online course. Students should be comfortable working with the Internet, email, and word processing (such as Word).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. The regular routine after you are enrolled: </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log on - to BlackBoard using your personal User Name and Password.</li>
        <li>Choose course - click on the course that you want to work on. </li>
        <li>Check announcements </li>
        <li>Read - Click on the Course Material section to read the material for the week.</li>
        <li>Work on assignments</li>
        <li>Class discussion - On the Communication page click "Discussion Board." Comment on the topic the instructor has posted and respond to comments from other students.</li>
        <li>Homework - complete textbook reading, projects and papers.</li>    
        <li>Turn in Assignments - Turn in all homework to the Digital Drop Box in your BlackBoard site or email them to your professor.</li>
        <li>Keep in communication- Correspond with your instructors.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p><strong><a name="Time"></a>How much time will I spend online?</strong></p>
    <p>In a 3 credit hour course, you should expect to spend an average of 9-12 hours per week on your course work. Depending on your speed of reading and the amount of particular assignments for the course, you will be online approximately 4-5 hours a week. This time may be decreased if you download documents and read them off-line and may be increased if you participate extensively in additional chat room discussions.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Time2"></a>Do I have to be online at any specific time?</strong></p>
    <p>For most classes you do not need to be online at any particular time. Occasionally, a class will require you to be online at a particular time. However, the software we use for the online school is interactive. You will have a chance to communicate with the other students and the instructor. Communication is mostly through email and bulletin board, so you can get online at the time most convenient for you. We do use chat features, but that is your choice; it is not a requirement to communicate with the other students and the instructor through chat.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Instructors"></a>Who are my instructors?</strong></p>
    <p>The online classes will be taught by the Faculty and Adjunct Faculty who currently teach on campus at CSBS. Occasionally, we will have a guest professor from another institution teach an online class.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Courses2"></a>How are courses taught? How is the lecture presented?</strong></p>
    <p>Generally, the instructor for each course determines its guidelines and how it will be taught. Usually there is an online course syllabus that summarizes the goals and objectives of the course. Some courses have formal lectures, similar in length and content to lectures given in face-to-face classes. Online lectures may be entirely text-based or consist of some combination of text, graphics, sound and video. Other courses break the content up into smaller units or abandon the lecture entirely, instead relying on group discussion and others types of learning activities. Most classes use a Web-based conferencing system or electronic mail as the primary tool for communication between students and the instructor. </p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Exams"></a>How do I take exams?</strong></p>
    <p>Exams are taken online.  Your instructor will make the exam available to you during a fixed time frame.  The exams are timed and you will only be able to take them once.  Your instructor will make it clear when you need to take the exams.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Tuition"></a>What are the tuition costs?</strong></p>
    <p>Please see the online/intensive courses web pages or email the <a href="/contact-registrar.html">registrar</a> for details.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <p><strong><a name="Terms"></a>What do the terms "real-time " and "asynchronous " mean?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time activities are "live" and immediate. In the context of an online course, a real-time session is one in which all participants are logged on at the same time and interacting at more or less the same pace as one would in a face-to-face setting. A familiar example of real-time communication on the Internet is live chat.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous activities, on the other hand, are those in which participation is not concurrent or live. One member of the class, for example, might post a message in the morning, and another might not read or respond to it until later that day or even several days later. Electronic mail is the most common form of asynchronous communication, but there are many others as well.</li>
        <li>The course instructor usually determines the proportion of real-time and asynchronous communication in an online course. Some instructors may require a certain number of pre-scheduled real-time sessions, while others may organize their classes completely around asynchronous learning to give their students more freedom.</li>
    </ul>
