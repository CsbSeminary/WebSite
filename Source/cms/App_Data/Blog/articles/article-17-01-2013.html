<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">SEMINARY DAY 2013 is MARCH 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: black;">Seminary Day 2013</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> for the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary and College is <strong>March3</strong>, the first Sunday of the month and the beginning of our reading week.</span> <span style="color: black;">If you would like to join us in highlighting CSBS&amp;C training and praying for the school on this annual date, we can supply you with a current fact sheet for updating your congregation on our recent activities, along with helpful information on degree and distance programs for those who have a personal interest in what the college and seminary offer.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">As you know Seminary Day is the date we arrange for as many students as possible to visit CNBC churches across Canada. Some of our churches have expressed the specific desire to create a hands-on learning experience for students and we appreciate this very practical partnership.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Churches that would like a student for Seminary Day should contact me at their earliest convenience to arrange the student&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; Students can be asked to preach and/or serve in some other aspect of church ministry, such as personal sharing of their college/seminary journey, joining you in a community outreach or teaching a Sunday School class.&nbsp; Remember that the host church takes the responsibility to feed, house and transport the student during their visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">God&rsquo;s blessings as you anticipate His movement in your church and community this coming year. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">In the wonder of His grace,</span></p>
