<h1 style="color: #d81e00;">Seminary grads urged to<br />
learn who they are in Christ</h1>
<p>COCRANE, AB&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember a thing the speaker had to say on the day of my graduation from Southwestern Seminary,&rdquo; admitted Dr. Rick Lamb, pastor of Northside Baptist Church, Corsicana, Texas. With this confession, the guest speaker quickly caught the attention of the 11 graduands and their guests at the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary &amp; College (CSBS&amp;C) graduation on May 2. </p>
<p>As he graduated he knew his &ldquo;potential time&rdquo; was over and it was time to go out into the world and &ldquo;produce.&rdquo; However, after 24 years in full-time vocational ministry, Lamb is wary of the idea that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to produce&rdquo; and sees dangers in this philosophy. </p>
<p>In contrast, he encouraged graduates to learn who they are in Christ as quickly as possible. He warned against constantly comparing ourselves with others in ministry; being addicted to performance and approval; being critical or legalistic towards other Christians.<br />
Lamb asked those assembled, &ldquo;Who am I in Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer: I am the beloved of God; I am one who is constantly empowered by God. In Christ, I am to focus on being more than on doing. I am called to be faithful, not necessarily successful and I am one who has been invited to live life in all its fullness.</p>
<p>He shared Dallas Willard&rsquo;s &ldquo;divine conspiracy&rdquo; theory: &ldquo;The idea of a Divine Conspiracy is that in the eternal, perfect love of the Trinity&mdash;the love that has existed within the godhead for all eternity&mdash;there was a desire not only to make human beings, but to invite us in to the intimate circle of trinitarian love. And when we live there, the desire of God is to empower us to live our lives, with power, as if Jesus Christ Himself were living in our bodies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lamb advised graduates to &ldquo;lead from character&rdquo; rather than base their leadership solely on skills. He challenged them not to settle for a &ldquo;bland form of Christianity&rdquo; but to give themselves fully and joyfully to the Lord and to His work. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations on having come to this place in life,&rdquo; Lamb concluded, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t think of it as a destination. Think of it as part of the eternal plan of God who uses everything we have learned and experienced up until this point to help us serve Him where we are right now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The seminary conferred 12 degrees on 11 students, including 3 bachelor of Christian ministries, 3 master of arts in Christian education and 6 master of divinity degrees. </p>
