We are excited to announce the near completion of our <strong>25th Anniversary Celebration book!</strong> After a quarter of a century at CSBS&amp;C, it is time to pause and reflect. It is time to stand in the doorway, looking back to see the hand of God at work. Here is a sneak preview, featuring the opening lines of Dr. Karen Bullock's carefully researched account of the past twenty-five years...<blockquote style="text-align: left;">
"Standing atop the windswept hill overlooking the Bow River Valley, and surrounded by
the majestic Rocky Mountains, the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary in Cochrane, Alberta, bears witness to God&rsquo;s provision and bounty. In its twenty-fifth year of growth, the Seminary pauses to celebrate the work of God. For more than sixty years, Baptists in Canada worked toward, prayed for, and envisioned, a place where ministers called in Canada, trained in Canada, and ministering to Canadian churches, would become a reality. In thanksgiving to God, the story of God&rsquo;s grace among Canadian Baptists is retold in these brief pages. The setting for this tale is the land of soul-swelling, inexpressible beauty called Canada."<br />

</blockquote>In order to <em>complete the project</em> that celebrates the last twenty-five years, we've collected, scanned, and uploaded over 200 pictures online. It's sort of a photo-scavenger hunt... we need your help identifying people and places that we've captured over the years!<br />
<br />
Here's how you can help...<br />
<ol>
    <li>Press on the picture below where you can see all of the pictures, with corresponding numbers:<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Hkn_y5Xu8T5OL34eb1NrNmskR5u2AE15SYgEqhDm56A/edit" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Hkn_y5Xu8T5OL34eb1NrNmskR5u2AE15SYgEqhDm56A/pub?w=9618&amp;h=9410" style="width: 300px;" /></a></li>
    <li>Email the <a href="mailto:dan.kazmaier@csbs.ca?subject=CSBS&amp;C History Celebration Project">CSBS&amp;C Development Office</a>&nbsp;so we can give you <em>access</em> to an online spreadsheet that you can help us fill-in. Apart from identifying people and places, you get to create your own potential captions, and write about memories you associate with each picture!</li>
    <li>Share with others friends and family of CSBS&amp;C!</li>
