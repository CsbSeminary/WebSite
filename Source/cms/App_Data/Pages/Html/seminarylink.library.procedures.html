    <p>Regular circulating books may be checked out for a 30-day period and may be renewed as long as no other patron has placed a hold on a book. Renewals may be made by phone, email or in person. NEW BOOKS circulate for a 2-week loan period.</p>
    <p>A limit of 35 circulating items may be signed out by one individual in total, including audio/visual material. Reference books, periodicals, microforms, curriculum lab materials, and special collection materials do not circulate--they must be used in the library. Exceptions may be made through the librarian for classroom demonstrations or faculty office use. Audiocassettes and videocassettes circulate for one week, with a suggested limit of two videos per day. There is also a suggested limit of 10 single cassette tapes or 2 audiocassette sets.</p>

<div class="content-body">
    <p>All materials, RESERVE and circulating materials must be checked out through the circulation desk.</p>
    <p>You must have your library card with you in order to check out material. Each student/patron will have his/her own library or student i.d. card with a barcode on the back of it. An additional card may be requested for family use at no additional charge. However, replacement costs for lost library cards will be $5.00.</p>

<div class="content-title"><a name="holds">Placing Holds</a></div>
<div class="content-body">

    <p>Reserve books are located at the circulation desk and may be checked out through library staff or through the UCHECK system. Regular Reserve material may be borrowed for four hours during the day or for overnight after 2pm. Overnight books are due by 11 a.m. the next day the library is open. Books checked out on a Friday will not be due until Tuesday morning, 11 am. All textbooks as well as specific titles requested by professors are on CLOSED RESERVE. This means that the books can only be checked out to be used in the library only. There are those reserve materials that may be on a special 2-week loan period as requested by professors. A fine of $.25 per hour or part of an hour will be assessed for overdue reserve material.</p>

<div class="content-title"><a name="book_returns">Book Returns</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>Charged out books must be returned to the return box located at the circulation desk or outside the library door after hours. Books are considered overdue if not returned by the time the library closes on the due date.

</div>

<div class="content-title"><a name="fines">Fines</a></div>
<div class="content-body">

    <p>A fine charge of $.25 per day will be applied to each video that is overdue with a maximum fine of $2.50 per video. A one-day grace period will be given before overdue fines are assessed.

<div class="content-title"><a name="interlibrary">Interlibrary Loans</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>Our library utilizes an on-line interlibrary loan service through On-line Computer Library Center. This allows patrons to have access to hundreds of libraries across Canada and the United States. The service is generally free for patrons ordering books, however some libraries do charge for postage. You may also request journal articles through ILL at a nominal charge per page. Allow approximately two weeks for receiving book or journal requests. Ask the library staff for further information.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-title"><a name="classification">Classification System</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>Our library follows the Library of Congress classification system in organizing its holdings and uses Library of Congress subject headings for its subject catalogue. A classification system is simply a way of grouping books on similar topics together. Assigning sequences of letters and numbers to books so that subject arranges them logically together does this. If a call number has REF at the beginning of it, it is a reference book and will be found in the reference collection. If a call number begins with a "V" it is video material; if it begins with an "A" it is audio material. "Mfiche" or "Mfilm" refer to microfiche/film material located in the microfiche room. Journals are indicated by "PAPER JOURNAL", "MFICHE JOURNAL", "MFILM JOURNAL", "BOUND JOURNAL" in the call number area.</p>

<div class="content-title"><a name="reshelving">Reshelving Books</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>Please do not reshelf books used in the library. Leave them on the study tables or carrels in the stack area and let the library staff reshelf them. This helps in keeping circulation records and also insures better order in shelving.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-title"><a name="food">Food and Beverages</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>Generally, no food or beverages may be consumed within the library because of danger of damaging books and facilities. However, covered beverage containers, such as water bottles or coffee mugs with lids, may be used within study carrels.</p>
    <p><strong>Pop cans and other open drink containers ARE NOT allowed.</strong></p>
    <p>Students, faculty &amp; staff are expected to use other places to consume beverages and especially food. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<div class="content-title"><a name="talking">Talking and Cell Phone Use</a></div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>The library is to be a quiet place of study and research therefore loud talking and visiting in the library is strongly discouraged. The use of cell phones in the library proper is discouraged. Please keep cell phone use to a minimum and use the stairwell or outdoors for extended cell phone use. If the noise level is too distracting, please see library staff for assistance.</p><br>
