<h3>Giving to CSBS</h3>
<p>Our seminary is quite dependent on the Lord and His people to help us fulfill our mission to train church and ministry leaders for across Canada and around the world. Although our needs seem overwhelming at times, we are regularly reminded of the gracious and miraculous provision of our God.</p>
<p>People often ask how they can invest in the work that God is doing at our seminary. Below is a brief summary in how you can participate. Please don't ever hesitate to phone if we can answer any questions that you might have. You can contact <a href="mailto:Barry.Nelson@csbs.ca?subject=Giving%20to%20CSBS">Barry Nelson. Director of Development</a>, toll free at 877-922-2727, x264.</p>
<h3>Prayer Partners</h3>
<p>When speaking of his ministry, evangelist Sammy Tippitt says,"We don't believe that prayer is important. We believe that prayer is foundational!" This also is the heart of our ministry at the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary. We only want to follow the Lord's leadership in every aspect of our service to the Body of Christ and His kingdom.</p>
<p>We trust God to bring the students, faculty and necessary resources to accomplish His work through His seminary in Cochrane, Alberta. The vision of the Canadian Convention of Southern Baptists to plant 1,000 churches by the year 2020 is God-sized! A part of our mandate at the seminary is to help train the necessary leaders for this awesome task. The Lord has put us in a position of being dependent on Him for all of our needs. We are excited about having to rely on Him for all that He wants to accomplish here!</p>
<p>We are seeking prayer partners who will join us in seeking the Father for direction, provision, new students and God's blessing on His seminary here. We want you to rejoice with us as we see God work in awesome ways.</p>
<p>If you are interested in receiving e-mail prayer requests, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:partnership@csbs.ca">partnership@csbs.ca</a>.</p>
<h3>Campus Visitors</h3>
<p>We would love for you to consider visiting our campus. Many who visit our campus are blessed, inspired and challenged as they hear of God's work in the lives of our students. We invite you to come to the majestic Rocky Mountains to visit the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary. You'll discover some of the exciting ministries God is accomplishing through the lives of students, faculty and staff here. We encourage people to experience the vitality of God's activity in our midst. We would be glad to supply you with information on the best times to visit us and other places in the area you might want to see while you're here.</p>
<h3>Volunteers</h3>
<p>The buildings and furnishings on our campus are both beautiful and extremely functional. Most people are amazed to discover that the vast majority of construction, including our furniture, was built by volunteer labour. Because of the growth that the Lord continues to bring, we are constantly needing more space. The exceptional volunteer work force that the Lord has provided has allowed us to save substantial costs in construction.</p>
<p>There will always be work that can be done, especially during the summer season when construction takes place. If you are interested in volunteering, please contact us and we'll give you all the information you need. We are always grateful for the wonderful volunteers that God sends our way.</p>
<h3>Seminary Ambassadors</h3>
<p>We have often been told that our seminary is one of the best kept secrets around. Due to limited budgets and the high cost of advertising, we aren't able to promote the seminary as much as we would like through print and other media. This causes us to rely more heavily on word of mouth, which is always the best way to spread great news anyway!</p>
<p>If you know of people that God may be calling to ministry, we encourage you to have them check out the CSBS as a place to pray about attending for ministry preparation. We believe that we offer one of the finest programs to prepare people for the assignments to which God has called them.</p>
<p>You may also know of those who would visit, pray for, volunteer or financially support the seminary. We would encourage you to tell them about us! We would be happy to provide you with literature or other information to help you share all that the seminary has to offer. If you prefer, you can forward contact information to us, and we'll be happy to be in touch with those who are interested.</p>
<p>We have "Seminary Ambassador" business cards available that we would be happy to send to you. Please contact us and we'll send them to you immediately.</p>
<h3>Financial Investors</h3>
<p>Canada is a country that has tremendous spiritual need. Many churches struggle financially to be able pay one pastor and their mortgage or rent. There are churches in the United States that are larger than the entire Canadian Convention of Southern Baptists!</p>
<p>One of the things that the Canadian Southern Baptists view as vital is the training of leaders for ministry. Many people called to ministry have student loans from undergraduate degrees, as well as families to support. Due to the fact that many ministers in Canada will make great financial sacrifices to serve God, we try to keep the tuition to an extremely affordable amount.</p>
<p>Tuition only covers approximately 20% of the overhead of providing the quality education and training that we offer to students. We also receive support from the North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. The International Mission Board pays for our missionary professors and their expenses. We are extremely grateful for the financial assistance from N.A.M.B. and the I.M.B. Their support, however, only covers a portion of the operating and capital costs associated with providing a quality theological education. We still need to raise approximately 50% - 60% of our operating budget. This money comes from generous donations, large and small, from people who are excited about investing in what God is doing in Canada.</p>
<p>We are excited about God's work here! We humbly encourage people to pray, asking God if He would have them invest in what He is doing here in preparing leaders for ministry in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>You can financially support the work at the Seminary by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>making regular monthly donations</li>
    <li>giving special gifts for operating expenses or special projects</li>
    <li>including us in your church's mission budget</li>
    <li>remembering the seminary in your will or estate planning</li>
    <li>purchasing a life insurance policy and naming the seminary as your beneficiary</li>
    <li>making a special gift honouring the memory of a loved one</li>
    <li>donating frequent flyer awards to be used for travel of staff or students</li>
    <li>making a special gift in the name of a friend or family member</li>
    <li>contributing to an existing scholarship or creating a new one</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide charitable tax receipts for both U.S. and Canadian donors. 100% of donations given are used for the support of the ministry of the seminary.</p>
<p>Again, we would be happy to share more of what God is doing at the Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary and ways that you can effectively invest in His work here. Please contact Barry Nelson with any information that you might need or with questions that we might answer.</p>
