    <h3>Student Life</h3>
    <p>Student life beyond the classroom is diverse and directed toward fellowship and ministry. Having students from other countries and cultures has greatly enriched school life. The international flavor of Chinese, Korean, Brazilian, Haitian, Lithuanian, Arabic, Spanish, Filipino, British, South African, Kenyan, Singaporean, Ethiopian, Dutch, and American students has broadened the seminary's world view. A picnic at the beginning of the academic year helps the entire seminary community get acquainted. Weekly Friday fellowships have a focus on sharing of events going on within the seminary family. Chapel services are conducted twice a week with a focus on scripture exposition and prayer. The annual Christmas party is a feast of food, fun and fellowship for students and their families. (Journey groups allow professors to talk informally with students about real-life issues and concerns.) Held in conjunction with spring break, the annual Seminary Day emphasis in the <i>Canadian Convention of Southern Baptists</i> gives students opportunities to minister in churches across Canada. Students also serve churches and other service organizations in a variety of ways on a regular basis in the greater Calgary and southern Alberta area. An interesting by-product of seminary life has been weddings. Thus far, ten single students have found life partners while studying at seminary.</p>
    <h3>Financial Aid</h3>
    <p>Financial aid for students is important. When the school opened in 1987 only two scholarships were available. The <i>Canadian Convention of Southern Baptists</i> scholarship provides a substantial tuition subsidy for each student who is a member of a <i>Canadian Southern Baptist church</i>. The Len Koster Memorial scholarship is awarded annually and gives preference to older students who feel God's call to share His word and establish churches in Canada or elsewhere in the world. Presently, the seminary has twelve scholarships that provide financial aid to students. These scholarships provide financial help to students ranging from First Nations students to those called to serve as foreign missionaries.</p>
    <h3>Post-School</h3>
    <p>As of May 2003 the school has 97 alumni, which total includes six Doctor of Ministry graduates. Currently 78 percent of the alumni serve in ministry vocations. Graduates have ministered in Canada from Vancouver Island to New Brunswick and in the United States. Alumni serve as pastors, church planters, university chaplains, college professors, foreign missionaries, convention staff personnel, national leadership board members, seminary trustees, and Advisory Council members. Alumnus, Bill Anderson (1992), graduated from the University of Glasgow, Scotland in the fall of 1997 with a Ph.D. in Old Testament studies.</p>
    <p>Early pioneers in <i>Canadian Southern Baptist</i> life had a vision. Training God-called Canadians in Canada for Christian ministry was their hope and dream. The vision is being fulfilled in the lives of those who go out from the seminary to serve in churches in Canada and in foreign lands.</p>
    <p>The reach of "Men of Vision" begins in the foothills and coulees of Cochrane, Alberta and extends across Canada and into the nations of the world. To God be the glory, great things He has done.</p>
