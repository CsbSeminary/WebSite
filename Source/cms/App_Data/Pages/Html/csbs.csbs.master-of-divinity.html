<h4>Distance MDiv at <a target="_blank" href="/pages/seminarylink/distance/default.html" re_target="_blank">SeminaryLink.com</a></h4>
<p>The Seminary also offers the MDiv degree through <a href="http://www.SeminaryLink.com" target="_self">SeminaryLink.com</a> to students who are unable to relocate to the Cochrane campus. This program combines online course offerings in the fall and spring semesters with January and May/June intensive on-campus courses. Students can remain in their ministry settings and still complete the entire MDiv degree. The program is flexible enough so that a student can start at virtually anytime.</p>
<p>In each course, an on-line learning community is formed through discussion boards (threaded discussion), chat-rooms, collaborative online student group projects, weekly faculty monitoring of responses, the provision of online chapels with streamed audio, and orientations to help the students feel part of the CSBS family.</p>
<p>The yearly J-term (January and May/June) intensives will provide not only one-third of the MDiv degree but also make possible on-campus opportunities to meet with classmates face to face.</p>
<p>Online class and course packages are made up of weekly text-based curriculum materials enhanced by PowerPoint, audio and video streaming, and the use of electronic links such as the online library catalogue, periodical base, a Web Electronic Resources page listing biblical dictionaries, commentaries, free Bible software from Washburn Institute and other comparable biblical and theological educational resources.
