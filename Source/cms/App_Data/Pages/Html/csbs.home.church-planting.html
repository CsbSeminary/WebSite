            The Canadian Southern Baptist Seminary has a strong church planting focus. Every student studying for an M.Div degree takes at least one course in church planting. In addition to the M.Div, we offer an MA in Christian Ministry, Church Planting track. <br />
            <br />
            Our passion for training young leaders to start new churches in the tough places of North America goes deeper than just classes. Our Professor of Church Planting, Dr. Daniel J. Morgan, has spent over thirty years in different aspects of church planting with the last ten involved in training and mentoring church planters. Five of the other faculty are veteran missionaries who bring a practical, field-based perspective to training students for ministry. <br />
            <br />
            The degree in church planting as well as the M.Div degree include practical field experience. Because so many of our churches are recent plants, there are many opportunities to work along side a planter and learn by doing. <br />
            <br />
            Students feeling a call to church planting will be assessed by veteran church planters for aptitude as a lead planter or other church planting role, they will receive classroom training, and will be connected with a current or veteran church planter for internships and mentoring in the skills needed to plant a church. <br />
            <br />
            Upon graduation, qualified students will be helped to form or join a church planting team and deploy to an under-churched area of Canada. Some will plant with funding provided by a partnership of organizations and churches associated with the Canadian National Baptist Convention. Others, with trade skills or a professional background will plant; supporting their family by practicing their trade or profession.&nbsp;</td>
