<p>The Seminary now offers the M. Div. degree through SeminaryLink.com to students who are unable to relocate to the Cochrane campus as resident students. This program combines online course offerings in the fall and spring semesters with January and May-June intensive on-campus courses. Now students can remain in their ministry settings and still complete the entire M. Div. degree. The program is flexible enough so that a student can start at virtually anytime.</p>
<p>In each course, there is intentional building of an on-line learning community via discussion boards (threaded discussion), chat-rooms, collaborative on-line student group projects, weekly faculty monitoring of responses, the provision of on-line chapels with streamed audio, and orientations to help the students feel part of the CSBS family.&nbsp; The yearly&nbsp;(January, May and June) intensives will provide on-campus opportunities to build community as well.</p>
<p>On-line class and course packages are made up of weekly text-based curriculum materials enhanced by PowerPoint, audio and video streaming, and the use of electronic links such as the on-line library catalogue, periodical base, a Web Electronic Resources page listing biblical dictionaries, commentaries, free Bible software and other comparable biblical and theological educational resources.  Please see the rest of the website for more details or contact the <a href="/contact-registrar.html">registrar</a> for information about upcoming courses</p>
